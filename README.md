ColorMime
=========
ColorMime is a simple plugin for Sketch which allows you to quickly duplicate any Colourlovers palatte in your sketch project.  Simply create a rectangle of any size, run the plugin and paste the palatte URL into the prompt window.  ColorMime will automatically build the palatte using the original rectangle as a template (in terms of size).

Massive credit to alssndro (https://github.com/alssndro/).  Most of the code for this plugin comes from his random color palatte plugin -
