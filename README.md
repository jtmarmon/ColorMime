ColorMime is a simple plugin for Sketch which allows you to quickly duplicate any Colourlovers palette in your sketch project.  Simply create a rectangle of any size, run the plugin and paste the palette URL into the prompt window.  ColorMime will automatically build the palette using the original rectangle as a sizing template.
