================

ColorMime is a simple plugin for Sketch which allows you to quickly duplicate any Colourlovers palette in your sketch project.  Simply create a rectangle of any size, run the plugin and paste the palette URL into the prompt window.  ColorMime will automatically build the palette using the original rectangle as a sizing template.

Massive credit to [alssndro](https://github.com/alssndro/).  Most of the code for this plugin comes from his random color [palatte plugin](https://github.com/alssndro/sketch-plugins/blob/master/Colours/Create%20Random%20Colour%20Palette%20(Random).sketchplugin).
